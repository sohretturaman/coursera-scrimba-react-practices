      <p >
        I am a good listener and learner, able to communicate well with a group
        and on an individual level. I am able to motivate and direct my talents
        and skills to meet objectives. I always seek to achieve a high standard
        in whatever work I undertake. I am well organised with a clear and
        positive approach to problem solving.
